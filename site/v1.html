    <p>Version 1.0 of VOOT was the output of the GÉANT3 effort, and is still in use in some systems.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p> VOOT 1.0 is a simple protocol for cross-domain read-only access to information
        about users' group membership within an organization or aggregated across
        organizations and their role in these groups. It can be seen as making a subset
        of LDAP-like information available through a web service.
    </p>

    <p>
        The API is loosely based on the OpenSocial specification and a first iteration during GN3-JRA3-T2 project. This
        is just
        for historical reasons and not all requirements of OpenSocial nor previous
        versions of VOOT are met. One such example is that only the JSON data format
        is supported. This specification does however aim to be backwards compatible
        requiring little to know change to existing VOOT software.
    </p>

    <h2 id="notationalcoventions">Notational Conventions</h2>

    <p>
        The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD',
        'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be
        interpreted as described in [<a href="#rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>].
    </p>

    <h2 id="usecases">Usecases</h2>

    <p>
        All the use cases that are valid for accessing group membership data from an
        organization's LDAP are also valid for VOOT. For instance, requesting
        information about users' group memberships and the members of a group. However,
        as opposed to LDAP, VOOT is not meant to perform user authentication.
    </p>

    <p>
        Web applications sometimes have the ability to interface with LDAP directly to
        access information about users in the organization's directory (and
        authenticate users), but this is notoriously hard or even impossible to get
        working cross-domain in a secure way, except by using RADIUS, but this is
        not supported by web browsers, so out of scope.
    </p>

    <h2 id="provider">Provider</h2>

    <p>
        This document describes the protocol used between application (client) and
        VOOT provider. This documents specifies the VOOT API, which is a REST API.
        The protocol is protected using an authentication mechanism described in the
        next section.
    </p>

    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/img/voot/vootv1-overview.png"></p>

    <h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

    <p>
        An application (client) has two ways to authenticate to the VOOT provider, it
        is up to the provider to support one, or both, of those:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieve a list of groups the user is a member of;</li>
        <li>Retrieve the list of people that are member of a group the user is also a
            member of.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Technically, OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework and not intended for
        authentication, however, from the point of view of the VOOT provider the
        client authenticates to the API using an access token.</p>

    <h2 id="api">API</h2>

    <p> The VOOT API support two calls:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieve a list of groups the user is a member of;</li>
        <li>Retrieve the list of people that are member of a group the user is also a
            member of.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For the API calls one has to specify the user identifier for which the
        information is retrieved. For API calls using OAuth 2.0 the @me placeholder
        identifier MUST be supported which is replaced in the provider with the actual
        user identifier that authorized the client to act on its behalf. With this
        placeholder the client accessing information about the user does not need to
        know the unique identifier of the user at the provider. Specifying an user
        identifier MAY be supported by the OAuth 2.0 protected provider, however this
        is not recommended.
    </p>

    <p>
        For Basic Authentication an actual user identifier and group identifier MUST be
        specified, @me is not supported here due to the lack of binding with an user
        that authorized the client to act on its behalf. It is out of scope how the
        client obtains the identifiers of the user, or group.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the user <code>John</code> authorized a client to act on its behalf, with an OAuth 2.0
        protected provider the following calls are defined, of which only the first one
        MUST be implemented:
    </p>

{% highlight html %}
/groups/@me
/people/@me/students
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        If information about the user <code>John</code> is queried by a client using Basic
        Authentication the following calls are defined, of which only the first one
        MUST be implemented:
    </p>

{% highlight html %}
/groups/john
/people/john/students
{% endhighlight %}

    <h2 id="oauth">OAuth</h2>

    <p>
        In order to retrieve data from the VOOT service, it is required that the client
        specifies what type of call it wants to perform. For any of the calls a
        different scope is required. Multiple scopes can be combined:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieving a list of groups the user is a member of, requires the scope
            <code>http://openvoot.org/groups</code>;
        </li>
        <li>Retrieving the list of people that are member of a group the user is also a
            member of, also requires the scope <code>http://openvoot.org/people</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For backwards compatibility the scope read will give access to all the
        above, assuming there are no other server side restrictions.
    </p>

    <h2 id="retrievemembership">Retrieve Group Membership</h2>

    <p>this call retrieves a list of groups the user is a member of</p>

{% highlight html %}
/groups/@me
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>or</p>

{% highlight html %}
/groups/[userId]
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>Where <code>[userId]</code> is replaced with an idenfier of the user at the provider. This
        call MUST be supported. The response can include the following keys:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>(REQUIRED) <code>id</code>: The, to the provider, local unique identifier of the group;</li>
        <li>(REQUIRED) <code>voot_membership_role</code>: The role the user has in this group;</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) <code>title</code>: The short human readable name of the group;</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) <code>description</code>: A description of the group.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The <code>id</code> field SHOULD be opaque to the client. The field <code>voot_membership_role</code>
        can be any of these values: admin, manager or member.
    </p>

    <h2 id="retrievemembers">Retrieve Members of a Group</h2>

    <p>This call retrieves a list of all members of a group the user is a member of:</p>


{% highlight html %}
/people/@me/[groupId]
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>or</p>

{% highlight html %}
/people/[userId]/[groupId]
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        Where <code>[userId]</code> is replaced with an identifier of the user at the provider
        and <code>[groupId]</code> replaced with a group identifier which was obtained through for
        instance the call used to retrieve group membership for a particular user.</p>

    <p>
        This call MAY be supported. The response can include the following keys:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>(REQUIRED) <code>id</code>: The, to the provider, local unique identifier of the user;</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) <code>displayName</code>: The name by which the user prefers to be addressed;</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) <code>voot_membership_role</code>: The role the user has in this group;</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) <code>emails</code>: The email address(es) of the user;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The <code>id</code> field SHOULD be opaque to the client. The field <code>voot_membership_role</code>
        can be any of these values: <code>admin</code>, <code>manager</code> or <code>member</code>. The user MUST be a
        member, but not necessary have the role <code>member</code> of the group being queried. The
        <code>emails</code> field SHOULD contain a list of email addresses which provides the
        type to be any of <code>work</code>, <code>home</code> or <code>other</code>. For example:
    </p>

{% highlight json %}
{
	"emails": [
		{
			"type": "work",
			"value": "bmcatee@students.example.edu"
		}
	]
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <h2 id="requestparameters">Request Parameters</h2>

    <p>The API calls have three OPTIONAL parameters that manipulate the result
        obtained from the provider:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>sortBy</code></li>
        <li><code>startIndex</code></li>
        <li><code>count</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The <code>sortBy</code> parameter determines the key in the result that is used for sorting
        the groups or group members. It can be any of the mentioned keys mentioned in
        the previous section:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>id</code></li>
        <li><code>displayName</code></li>
        <li><code>title</code></li>
        <li><code>description</code></li>
        <li><code>voot_membership_role</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If the key is not available in the set being sorted, the results are not sorted
        or sorted at the provider's discretion. It is up to the provider whether or not
        to sort and by what key in what order if these parameters are not present.
        If the results are to be sorted, the value SHOULD be compared as strings and
        SHOULD be sorted case-insensitive in ascending order.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>startIndex</code> parameter determines the offset as an integer >= 0 at which
        the start for giving back results. The <code>count</code> parameter, an integer >= 0
        indicates the number of results to be given back. The <code>startIndex</code> and count
        parameters can be used to implement paging by returning only a subset of the
        results. These parameters are OPTIONAL, if they are not provided or invalid the
        provider MUST consider <code>startIndex</code> equal to 0 and <code>count</code> equal to the total
        number of items available in the entire set for the particular query.
    </p>

    <p>The sorting, if requested, MUST be performed on the provider before applying
        limiting the results based on the <code>startIndex</code> and <code>count</code> parameters.
    </p>

    <p>For the API call, requesting user information, the <code>sortBy</code> parameter has no
        effect. Using <code>startIndex</code> and <code>count</code> is possible, however they are of little
        use as there always will be only one answer, assuming the user exists.
    </p>

    <h2 id="responseparameters">Response Parameters</h2>

    <p>
        All responses mentioned above have the same JSON structure. There are always
        four keys:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>startIndex</code></li>
        <li><code>itemsPerPage</code></li>
        <li><code>totalResults</code></li>
        <li><code>entry</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Where <code>startIndex</code> contains the offset from which the results are returned,
        this is usually equals to the requested <code>startIndex</code>. The <code>itemsPerPage</code>
        contains the actual number of results in the response set, as part of entry,
        returned. The <code>totalResults</code> field contains the full number of elements
        available, not depending on the <code>startIndex</code> and <code>count</code> parameters.
    </p>

    <p>The <code>entry</code> key contains a list of items, either groups, people or person
        information. Below are some examples.
    </p>

    <h2 id="apiexample">API Examples</h2>

    <p>Below are some API examples for retrieve group membership, a list of group
        members and information about the user.</p>

    <h4>Retrieve Group Membership</h4>

    <p>
        This is an example of the response to the query:
    </p>

{% highlight http %}

GET /groups/@me?sortBy=title HTTP/1.1
Host: provider.example.org

{% endhighlight %}

    <p>The response looks like this:</p>

{% highlight http %}

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"entry": [
		{
			"description": "Group containing employees.",
			"id": "employees",
			"title": "Employees",
			"voot_membership_role": "admin"
		},
		{
			"description": "Group containing everyone at this institute.",
			"id": "members",
			"title": "Members",
			"voot_membership_role": "member"
		}
	],
	"itemsPerPage": 2,
	"startIndex": 0,
	"totalResults": 2
}

{% endhighlight %}

    <h4>Retrieve Members of a Groups</h4>

    <p>
        This is an example of the response to the query:
    </p>

{% highlight http %}

GET /people/@me/members?sortBy=displayName&startIndex=3&count=2 HTTP/1.1
Host: provider.example.org

{% endhighlight %}

    <p>The response looks like this:</p>

{% highlight http %}

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

			"voot_membership_role": "member"
		}
	],
	"itemsPerPage": 2,
	"startIndex": 3,
	"totalResults": 7
}

{% endhighlight %}

    <h2 id="errorhandling">Error Handling</h2>

    <p>
        Handling failures of Authentication, either Basic or Bearer are handled in the
        ways described in [<a href="#rfc2617">RFC 2617</a>] and [<a href="#rfc6750">RFC 6750</a>]. This will involve sending the
        WWW-Authenticate header if something is wrong, for example an invalid
        OAuth 2.0 access token will result in the following response:
    </p>

{% highlight http %}

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="Resource Server",error="invalid_token",error_description="the access token is not valid"
Content-Type: application/json

{"error":"invalid_token","error_description":"the access token is not valid"}

{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        There are also some request errors defined, i.e.: invalid requests to the
        provider that should be dealt with in a certain manner. Only the call that
        retrieves group membership MUST be supported, the other calls do not need to be
        supported. When this call is disabled a response code of <code>400 Bad Request</code> is
        returned with <code>error</code> set to <code>invalid_request</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The error response is returned as JSON, for example:
    </p>

{% highlight http %}

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "error": "invalid_user"
}

{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        The <code>error</code> field MUST be present.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Retrieve Group Membership
    </h4>

    <p>
        The call looks like this:
    </p>

{% highlight html %}

/groups/@me

{% endhighlight %}

<ul>
    <li>If Basic Authentication is used and @me is used an error response with
    code <code>404 Not Found</code> is returned. The <code>error</code> field contains <code>invalid_user</code>.
    If a user identifier is specified instead of <code>@me</code> for providers not
    supporting the use of user identifiers the same error is returned;</li>

    <li>If the specified user does not exist at the provider an error response with
    code<code>404 Not Found</code> is returned. The <code>error</code> field contains <code>invalid_user</code>;</li>

    <li>If any other error occurs an error response with code
    <code>500 Internal Server Error</code> is returned. The <code>error</code> field contains
    <code>internal_server_error</code>.</li>
</ul>

    <h4>
        Retrieve Members of a Group
    </h4>

    <p>
        The call looks like this:
    </p>

{% highlight html %}

/groups/@me/members

{% endhighlight %}


    <ul>
        <li>If Basic Authentication is used and @me is used an error response with
            code <code>404 Not Found</code> is returned. The <code>error</code> field contains <code>invalid_user</code>.
            If a user identifier is specified instead of <code>@me</code> for providers not
            supporting the use of user identifiers the same error is returned;</li>

        <li>If the specified user does not exist at the provider an error response with
            code<code>404 Not Found</code> is returned. The <code>error</code> field contains <code>invalid_user</code>;</li>

        <li>
            If the specified user is not a member of the group an error response with
            code <code>403 Forbidden</code> is returned. The <code>error</code> field contains <code>not_a_member</code>.
            This response MUST be returned when the user is not a member, no matter
            whether the group actually exists or not;</li>

        <li>If any other error occurs an error response with code
            <code>500 Internal Server Error</code> is returned. The <code>error</code> field contains
            <code>internal_server_error</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="proxyoperations">Proxy Operation</h2>

    <p>
        One of the use cases is to make it possible to combine data from various
        group providers using one API service. This way group membership information
        can be aggregated from various sources. The proxy provides an OAuth 2.0
        protected API to clients and in the backend uses Basic Authentication to talk
        to the group providers from which it needs to aggregate data.
    </p>

    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/img/voot/vootv1-proxy.png"></p>

    <p>
        From the client's point of view there should be no difference in the API
        compared to talking directly to a group provider. There are however some
        special error cases that should be considered. For instance if (one of) the
        remote group providers is not available. Also the group identifiers that were
        scoped locally per group provider need to be modified to include a 'scope',
        i.e. to indicate to what group provider they belong.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example the user <code>John</code>, which is a local identifier at a group provider
        can occur in multiple group providers, so it needs to be matched to this
        particular group provider, for example prefixed with the identifier of the
        group provider. The prefixed value SHOULD be opaque to the client as well.
    </p>

    <h2 id="idfedconsiderations">Identity Federation Considerations</h2>

    <p> The VOOT protocol is not meant to authenticate users at a service. For this,
        other mechanisms such as federated identity protocols like SAML, OpenID Connect
        or Mozilla Persona exists. What needs to be considered here is making sure the
        identifiers used in the authentication layer are the same as used by the group
        provider when exposing this information to clients.
    </p>

    <p>In SAML for instance there is the persistent opaque identifier provided to
        Service Provider (SP) through the NameID value. This is an identifier that
        remains constant for a particular user per SP. This way, SPs cannot match the
        same user between themselves based on this identifier alone.
    </p>

    <p>This only needs to be considered when implementing the call that retrieves
        group members. For just retrieving the group identifiers there can be any
        mechanism to make the values opaque as this information is typically not
        provided through the SAML assertion. </p>

    <h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>

    <p>
        The roles <code>admin</code>, <code>manager</code> and <code>member</code> are not well defined. Their actual
        semantics is based on what the application considers to be an <code>admin</code>, <code>manager</code>
        or <code>member</code>. However, in general, the following can be said about the roles:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            A user with role <code>admin</code> has more rights than a user with role <code>manager</code> or
            role <code>member</code>;
        </li>
        <li>
            A user with role <code>manager</code> has more rights than a user with role <code>member</code>;
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For more fine grained roles the use of an entitlement based system is
        recommended, which is out of scope of this specification.
    </p>

    <h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>

    <p>
        In order to maintain user privacy only the group membership API call should be
        allowed by third party clients. The other calls are not needed to determine
        group membership, e.g. to base application authorization on. If a user is a
        member of a particular group certain privileges may be granted based on just
        this fact.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only the <code>@me</code> user identifier should be allowed as to avoid needing to obtain
        unique user identifiers.
    </p>

    <p>
        If one makes use of the proxy scenario where the proxy provider is trusted,
        Basic Authentication can be used with for instance the local <code>uid</code> of the user.
        The proxy then SHOULD take care of making this information opaque towards the
        client and generate new identifiers for the same user for different clients.
    </p>

    <p>
        The calls to retrieve group members are unacceptable from the point of view of
        user privacy. Even if OAuth 2.0 is used this would leak user identifiers of
        other people to clients without the users that are a member of this group ever
        gave permissions for that. The impact of this can be minimized by making sure
        only the unique, opaque user identifier of the user is mentioned in the result
        and not other identifying information such as <code>displayName</code>. However, without
        these additional attributes this API call will be less useful.
    </p>
