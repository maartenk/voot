    <p>Version 1.0 of VOOT was the output of the GÃ‰ANT3 effort, and is still in use in some systems.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p> VOOT 1.0 is a simple protocol for cross-domain read-only access to information
        about users' group membership within an organization or aggregated across
        organizations and their role in these groups. It can be seen as making a subset
        of LDAP-like information available through a web service.
    </p>

    <p>
        The API is loosely based on the OpenSocial specification and a first iteration during GN3-JRA3-T2 project. This
        is just
        for historical reasons and not all requirements of OpenSocial nor previous
        versions of VOOT are met. One such example is that only the JSON data format
        is supported. This specification does however aim to be backwards compatible
        requiring little to know change to existing VOOT software.
    </p>

    <h2 id="notationalcoventions">Notational Conventions</h2>

    <p>
        The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD',
        'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be
        interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].
        <!-- TODO Link RFC -->
    </p>

    <h2 id="usecases">Usecases</h2>

    <p>
        All the use cases that are valid for accessing group membership data from an
        organization's LDAP are also valid for VOOT. For instance, requesting
        information about users' group memberships and the members of a group. However,
        as opposed to LDAP, VOOT is not meant to perform user authentication.
    </p>

    <p>
        Web applications sometimes have the ability to interface with LDAP directly to
        access information about users in the organization's directory (and
        authenticate users), but this is notoriously hard or even impossible to get
        working cross-domain in a secure way, except by using RADIUS, but this is
        not supported by web browsers, so out of scope.
    </p>

    <h2 id="provider">Provider</h2>

    <p>
        This document describes the protocol used between application (client) and
        VOOT provider. This documents specifies the VOOT API, which is a REST API.
        The protocol is protected using an authentication mechanism described in the
        next section.
    </p>

    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/img/voot/vootv1-overview.png"></p>

    <h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

    <p>
        An application (client) has two ways to authenticate to the VOOT provider, it
        is up to the provider to support one, or both, of those:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieve a list of groups the user is a member of;</li>
        <li>Retrieve the list of people that are member of a group the user is also a
            member of.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Technically, OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework and not intended for
        authentication, however, from the point of view of the VOOT provider the
        client authenticates to the API using an access token.</p>

    <h2 id="api">API</h2>

    <p> The VOOT API support two calls:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieve a list of groups the user is a member of;</li>
        <li>Retrieve the list of people that are member of a group the user is also a
            member of.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For the API calls one has to specify the user identifier for which the
        information is retrieved. For API calls using OAuth 2.0 the @me placeholder
        identifier MUST be supported which is replaced in the provider with the actual
        user identifier that authorized the client to act on its behalf. With this
        placeholder the client accessing information about the user does not need to
        know the unique identifier of the user at the provider. Specifying an user
        identifier MAY be supported by the OAuth 2.0 protected provider, however this
        is not recommended.
    </p>

    <p>
        For Basic Authentication an actual user identifier and group identifier MUST be
        specified, @me is not supported here due to the lack of binding with an user
        that authorized the client to act on its behalf. It is out of scope how the
        client obtains the identifiers of the user, or group.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the user <code>John</code> authorized a client to act on its behalf, with an OAuth 2.0
        protected provider the following calls are defined, of which only the first one
        MUST be implemented:
    </p>

{% highlight html %}
/groups/@me
/people/@me/students
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        If information about the user <code>John</code> is queried by a client using Basic
        Authentication the following calls are defined, of which only the first one
        MUST be implemented:
    </p>

{% highlight html %}
/groups/john
/people/john/students
{% endhighlight %}

    <h2 id="oauth">OAuth</h2>

    <p>
        In order to retrieve data from the VOOT service, it is required that the client
        specifies what type of call it wants to perform. For any of the calls a
        different scope is required. Multiple scopes can be combined:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieving a list of groups the user is a member of, requires the scope
            <code>http://openvoot.org/groups</code>;
        </li>
        <li>Retrieving the list of people that are member of a group the user is also a
            member of, also requires the scope <code>http://openvoot.org/people</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For backwards compatibility the scope read will give access to all the
        above, assuming there are no other server side restrictions.
    </p>

    <h2 id="retrievemembership">Retrieve Group Membership</h2>

    <p>this call retrieves a list of groups the user is a member of</p>

{% highlight html %}
/groups/@me
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>or</p>

{% highlight html %}
/groups/[userId]
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>Where <code>[userId]</code> is replaced with an idenfier of the user at the provider. This
        call MUST be supported. The response can include the following keys:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>(REQUIRED) <code>id</code>: The, to the provider, local unique identifier of the group;</li>
        <li>(REQUIRED) <code>voot_membership_role</code>: The role the user has in this group;</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) <code>title</code>: The short human readable name of the group;</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) <code>description</code>: A description of the group.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The <code>id</code> field SHOULD be opaque to the client. The field <code>voot_membership_role</code>
        can be any of these values: admin, manager or member.
    </p>

    <h2 id="retrievemembers">Retrieve Members of a Group</h2>

    <p>This call retrieves a list of all members of a group the user is a member of:</p>


{% highlight html %}
/people/@me/[groupId]
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>or</p>

{% highlight html %}
/people/[userId]/[groupId]
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        Where <code>[userId]</code> is replaced with an identifier of the user at the provider
        and <code>[groupId]</code> replaced with a group identifier which was obtained through for
        instance the call used to retrieve group membership for a particular user.</p>

    <p>
        This call MAY be supported. The response can include the following keys:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>(REQUIRED) <code>id</code>: The, to the provider, local unique identifier of the user;</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) <code>displayName</code>: The name by which the user prefers to be addressed;</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) <code>voot_membership_role</code>: The role the user has in this group;</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) <code>emails</code>: The email address(es) of the user;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The <code>id</code> field SHOULD be opaque to the client. The field <code>voot_membership_role</code>
        can be any of these values: <code>admin</code>, <code>manager</code> or <code>member</code>. The user MUST be a
        member, but not necessary have the role <code>member</code> of the group being queried. The
        <code>emails</code> field SHOULD contain a list of email addresses which provides the
        type to be any of <code>work</code>, <code>home</code> or <code>other</code>. For example:
    </p>

{% highlight json %}
{
	"emails": [
		{
			"type": "work",
			"value": "bmcatee@students.example.edu"
		}
	]
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <h2 id="requestparameters">Request Parameters</h2>

    <p>The API calls have three OPTIONAL parameters that manipulate the result
        obtained from the provider:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>sortBy</code></li>
        <li><code>startIndex</code></li>
        <li><code>count</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The <code>sortBy</code> parameter determines the key in the result that is used for sorting
        the groups or group members. It can be any of the mentioned keys mentioned in
        the previous section:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>id</code></li>
        <li><code>displayName</code></li>
        <li><code>title</code></li>
        <li><code>description</code></li>
        <li><code>voot_membership_role</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If the key is not available in the set being sorted, the results are not sorted
        or sorted at the provider's discretion. It is up to the provider whether or not
        to sort and by what key in what order if these parameters are not present.
        If the results are to be sorted, the value SHOULD be compared as strings and
        SHOULD be sorted case-insensitive in ascending order.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>startIndex</code> parameter determines the offset as an integer >= 0 at which
        the start for giving back results. The <code>count</code> parameter, an integer >= 0
        indicates the number of results to be given back. The <code>startIndex</code> and count
        parameters can be used to implement paging by returning only a subset of the
        results. These parameters are OPTIONAL, if they are not provided or invalid the
        provider MUST consider <code>startIndex</code> equal to 0 and <code>count</code> equal to the total
        number of items available in the entire set for the particular query.
    </p>

    <p>The sorting, if requested, MUST be performed on the provider before applying
        limiting the results based on the <code>startIndex</code> and <code>count</code> parameters.
    </p>

    <p>For the API call, requesting user information, the <code>sortBy</code> parameter has no
        effect. Using <code>startIndex</code> and <code>count</code> is possible, however they are of little
        use as there always will be only one answer, assuming the user exists.
    </p>

    <h2 id="responseparameters">Response Parameters</h2>

    <p>
        All responses mentioned above have the same JSON structure. There are always
        four keys:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>startIndex</code></li>
        <li><code>itemsPerPage</code></li>
        <li><code>totalResults</code></li>
        <li><code>entry</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Where <code>startIndex</code> contains the offset from which the results are returned,
        this is usually equals to the requested <code>startIndex</code>. The <code>itemsPerPage</code>
        contains the actual number of results in the response set, as part of entry,
        returned. The <code>totalResults</code> field contains the full number of elements
        available, not depending on the <code>startIndex</code> and <code>count</code> parameters.
    </p>

    <p>The <code>entry</code> key contains a list of items, either groups, people or person
        information. Below are some examples.
    </p>

    <h2 id="apiexample">API Examples</h2>
