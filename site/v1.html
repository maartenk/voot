    <p>Version 1.0 of VOOT was the output of the GÃ‰ANT3 effort, and is still in use in some systems.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p> VOOT 1.0 is a simple protocol for cross-domain read-only access to information
        about users' group membership within an organization or aggregated across
        organizations and their role in these groups. It can be seen as making a subset
        of LDAP-like information available through a web service.
    </p>

    <p>
        The API is loosely based on the OpenSocial specification and a first iteration during GN3-JRA3-T2 project. This
        is just
        for historical reasons and not all requirements of OpenSocial nor previous
        versions of VOOT are met. One such example is that only the JSON data format
        is supported. This specification does however aim to be backwards compatible
        requiring little to know change to existing VOOT software.

    <h2 id="notationalcoventions">Notational Conventions</h2>

    <p>
        The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD',
        'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be
        interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].
        <!-- TODO Link RFC -->
    </p>

    <h2 id="usecases">Usecases</h2>

    <p>
        All the use cases that are valid for accessing group membership data from an
        organization's LDAP are also valid for VOOT. For instance, requesting
        information about users' group memberships and the members of a group. However,
        as opposed to LDAP, VOOT is not meant to perform user authentication.
    </p>

    <p>
        Web applications sometimes have the ability to interface with LDAP directly to
        access information about users in the organization's directory (and
        authenticate users), but this is notoriously hard or even impossible to get
        working cross-domain in a secure way, except by using RADIUS, but this is
        not supported by web browsers, so out of scope.
    </p>

    <h2 id="provider">Provider</h2>

    <p>
        This document describes the protocol used between application (client) and
        VOOT provider. This documents specifies the VOOT API, which is a REST API.
        The protocol is protected using an authentication mechanism described in the
        next section.
    </p>

    <h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

    <p>
        An application (client) has two ways to authenticate to the VOOT provider, it
        is up to the provider to support one, or both, of those:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieve a list of groups the user is a member of;</li>
        <li>Retrieve the list of people that are member of a group the user is also a
            member of.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Technically, OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework and not intended for
        authentication, however, from the point of view of the VOOT provider the
        client authenticates to the API using an access token.</p>

    <h2 id="api">API</h2>

    <p> The VOOT API support two calls:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieve a list of groups the user is a member of;</li>
        <li>Retrieve the list of people that are member of a group the user is also a
            member of.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For the API calls one has to specify the user identifier for which the
        information is retrieved. For API calls using OAuth 2.0 the @me placeholder
        identifier MUST be supported which is replaced in the provider with the actual
        user identifier that authorized the client to act on its behalf. With this
        placeholder the client accessing information about the user does not need to
        know the unique identifier of the user at the provider. Specifying an user
        identifier MAY be supported by the OAuth 2.0 protected provider, however this
        is not recommended.
    </p>

    <p>
        For Basic Authentication an actual user identifier and group identifier MUST be
        specified, @me is not supported here due to the lack of binding with an user
        that authorized the client to act on its behalf. It is out of scope how the
        client obtains the identifiers of the user, or group.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the user <code>John</code> authorized a client to act on its behalf, with an OAuth 2.0
        protected provider the following calls are defined, of which only the first one
        MUST be implemented:
